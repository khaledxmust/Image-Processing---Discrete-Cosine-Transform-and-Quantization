Image Processing - Discrete Cosine Transform and Quantization algorithm

Developing a DCT algorithm to encode images in YUV format, Using 8x8 block and computing the DCT coefficients, then using a quantization matrix and reconstructing the images using IDCT and Computing the PSNR between the Source Image and the Reconstructed Image.

Steps:
1. Converting RGB to YUV Color Space
2. Split Image to 8x8 Blocks
3. DCT algorithm
4. Quantization
5. Inverse Quantization & IDCT algorithm
6. ReBuilding the Image
7. Plotting
8. Computing PSNR
